immediateshock,"The first property of conjunctive representations that should be mentioned is that they will support what is sometimes termed pattern completion (Marr, 1971; McNaughton & Morris, 1987; O’Reilly & McClelland,1994). When an input pattern of features (A, B, C, D, E) is conjoined into a memory representation, the presentation of a subset of the features (e.g., A, E) will activate the memory for the entire input pattern. | In pattern separation, similar inputs are encoded using distinct representations, whereas
pattern completion requires that similar inputs (e.g., the
original item and its subsequent retrieval cue) collapse
onto the same representations. | The principle of pattern completionis at the heart of the
